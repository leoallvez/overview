        id="IconLocation"
        severity="Warning"
        message="Found bitmap drawable `res/drawable/sample_poster.png` in densityless folder"
        category="Usability:Icons"
        priority="5"
        summary="Image defined in density-independent drawable folder"
        explanation="The res/drawable folder is intended for density-independent graphics such as shapes defined in XML. For bitmaps, move it to `drawable-mdpi` and consider providing higher and lower resolution versions in `drawable-ldpi`, `drawable-hdpi` and `drawable-xhdpi`. If the icon **really** is density independent (for example a solid color) you can place it in `drawable-nodpi`."
